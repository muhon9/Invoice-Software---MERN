## ðŸŽ¯ About

I have started this project before 2 years with the purpose of learning how to structure a full stack application wiht React and Expressjs<br/>

For lack of clear concept i paused it after implementing some features. In the next few months i have tried to clear my basic concepts. Now it will be a great time to start the project again and try to implement what i have learned in past few months. <br/>

I will update and push the codes regularly. Hope it will be a greate jurney<br/>
